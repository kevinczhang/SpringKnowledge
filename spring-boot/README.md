# Spring Boot

Each release of Spring Boot provides a **curated list of dependencies that it supports**. In practice, you do **not need to provide a version for any of these dependencies** in your build configuration, as Spring Boot manages that for you. When you upgrade Spring Boot itself, these dependencies are upgraded as well in a consistent way.

In Spring Boot, there is no requirement for XML configuration \(deployment descriptor\). It uses convention over configuration software design paradigm that means it decreases the effort of the developer.

### @SpringBootApplication Annotation <a id="using-boot-using-springbootapplication-annotation"></a>

```java
// same as @Configuration @EnableAutoConfiguration @ComponentScan
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

}
```

* `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: enable [Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration mechanism](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.4.RELEASE/reference/html/using-spring-boot.html#using-boot-auto-configuration)
* `@ComponentScan`: enable `@Component` scan on the package where the application is located \(see [the best practices](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.4.RELEASE/reference/html/using-spring-boot.html#using-boot-structuring-your-code)\)
* `@Configuration`: allow to register extra beans in the context or import additional configuration classes

## **Why Spring Boot ?**

* The dependency injection approach is used in Spring Boot.
* It contains powerful database transaction management capabilities.
* It simplifies integration with other Java frameworks like JPA/Hibernate ORM, Struts, etc.
* It reduces the cost and development time of the application.

## Advantages of Spring Boot

* It creates **stand-alone** Spring applications that can be started using Java **-jar**.
* It tests web applications easily with the help of different **Embedded** HTTP servers such as **Tomcat, Jetty,** etc. We don't need to deploy WAR files.
* It provides opinionated '**starter**' POMs to simplify our Maven configuration.
* It provides **production-ready** features such as **metrics, health checks,** and **externalized configuration**.
* There is no requirement for **XML** configuration.
* It offers a **CLI** tool for developing and testing the Spring Boot application.
* It offers the number of **plug-ins**.
* It also minimizes writing multiple **boilerplate codes** \(the code that has to be included in many places with little or no alteration\), XML configuration, and annotations.
* It **increases productivity** and reduces development time.

### **Inheriting the Starter Parent**

 To configure your project to inherit from the `spring-boot-starter-parent`, set the `parent` as follows:

```java
<!-- Inherit defaults from Spring Boot -->
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.4.RELEASE</version>
</parent>
```
